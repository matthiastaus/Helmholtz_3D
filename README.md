# 3D_polarized_traces

Polarized traces preconditioner for the 3D Helmholtz equation, discretized using finite differences plus absorbing boundary conditions realized via PML's.

This is an early prototype, which main purpouse is to show to design transmission conditions via a discrete Green's representation formula. This version of the code is matrix free and it doesn't use compressed linear algebra.

The notation was mostly taken from Zepeda-Núñez and Demanet, "The method of polarized traces for the 2D Helmholtz equation, JCP 2015"

We thank TOTAL for their genereous support.
